### What is Project Roots ?
A flutter app which includes personalized cognitive games for better memory reinforcement and to-do reminders for Dementia patients. 
Visual and memory based games which are a fun haven for senior
citizens.  All the games will be based on crucial information to the patient (collected through a query form and stored in firebase database ) thus, cognitive reinforcement is emphasized.

Classic word search game with a grid of letters and the user has to find key words or answers based on the hints on the hints page 

2. Reverse spell:
 User has to type the reverse spelling of the word thrown at him / her by the app (voice cue).  User can click on repeat word to hear the word again . 
 
3. Picture Quiz: 
Visual based questionnaire for visual memory reinforcement. Implemented a dashboard to track the number of right and wrong answers.
